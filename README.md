## Blink_it Sales

# Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze BlinkIt's retail sales data across various product and outlet characteristics to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable business insights. This includes examining product performance, outlet characteristics, and customer behavior to support better decision-making for inventory, marketing, and operations.

# Dataset
- <a href="https://github.com/Akashle017845/-Blink-It-Sales-Outlet-Analysis/blob/main/blinkit_data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Analysis Performed
# General Exploratory Analysis
- Loaded and sampled the dataset.

- Checked for null values and cleaned them.

- Converted categorical features for visualization.

# Data Cleaning
- Standardized fat content labels

- Handled missing weights and sizes

- Converted visibility outliers

## Business & Chart Analysis

# Sales Distribution Analysis
- By Item Fat Content (Bar chart & Box plot)

- By Product Type

- Fat Content vs Product Type (Stacked bar)

# Outlet Characteristics
- Sales by Outlet Type and Size

- Sales by Outlet Location Type

- Distribution of Outlet Establishment Year

- Combined analysis: Outlet Type + Outlet Size

# Visibility Analysis
- Histogram of Item Visibility

- Scatter Plot of Visibility vs Sales

- Correlation between Visibility & Sales by Product Type

# Key Insights
- Low Fat items have slightly higher average sales, but both types are widely sold.

- Product Type strongly impacts total sales — certain categories outperform others significantly.

- Outlet Type and Size are strong sales drivers. Supermarkets dominate in revenue.

- Newer outlets don’t always perform better — older outlets with strong product mixes still thrive.

- Higher visibility does not always guarantee higher sales — suggesting diminishing returns or poor shelf optimization.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive look at how BlinkIt’s product attributes and outlet characteristics affect sales performance. The results can inform decisions such as:

- Product promotions by fat content or type

- Optimizing outlet inventory by location

- Redesigning store layouts to better leverage visibility

- Prioritizing expansion in high-performing outlet types and locations
